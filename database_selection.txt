1.Identify the data needs for your solution:
sai :   Loadcell-Weight
	Gas sensor-Leakage value

2.system configuration of the edge server?


3.how much RAM and storage is available?

4.What data processing and decision making is delegated to the edge servers?
sai :	decision making is based on the gas sensor value (send notification)

5.Is the cloud solution deployed in one region, or is it dispersed across multiple regions?
sai :	In one region (dedicated instance)


6.What is the volume of data transferred from the device to the edge server, and from the edge server to the central server?



7.What is the estimate for the peak volume?
sai :	No peak volume only two data gas_weight and gas alert


8.What different formats of the data arrive from the devices, and what are the normalization, translation and filtering techniques applied on the data?



9.Does the IoT solution control the devices or actuators? If yes, what device features are controlled by the IoT solution? Do they require a real-time response?
sai :	No Actuators are used in the system


10.What is the expected turnaround time to respond to any critical event?
sai :	2s - 4s


11.What are the real-time analytics computed from the incoming data?
sai :	for now no real time analytics are needed.


12.What are the business insights derived from the historical data?
sai :	Usage of gas and tracking the demand of gas form client side.


13.What are the external services that depend on the data?
sai :	Mobile Notification and alert
